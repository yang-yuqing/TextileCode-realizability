# TextileCode-realizability
A valid input must be in this format:
separate each symbol by a space, and separate each word by a comma(no space between comma and the next symbol!)
for example:
h1+ 1 v2- 2+,h2+ v1+ 1- 2----> valid
h1+ 1 v2- 2+, h2+ v1+ 1- 2----> not valid (there is a space between comma and the next symbol!)
h1+1v2-2+,h2+v1+1-2----> not valid (no space between each symbol)
